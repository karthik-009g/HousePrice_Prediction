# HousePrice_Prediction
House Prices Prediction
This repository presents a machine learning project aimed at predicting house sale prices using data from Ames, Iowa. The dataset includes a rich set of features describing various aspects of residential homes, making it an excellent case study for regression modeling and real-world data analysis.
 
📌 Project Objective
The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can estimate the sale price of a house based on features such as:

Year and month of sale 

Lot square footage 

Number of bedrooms

And many other structural and location-based attributes

This project provides an opportunity to practice data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression modeling.

🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset files included in this repository are:

train.csv – Contains the training data with both features and the target variable (SalePrice).

test.csv – Contains the test data with features only; the goal is to predict SalePrice.

data_description.txt – Provides detailed information on each feature in the dataset (originally compiled by Dean De Cock).

sample_submission.csv – Example submission file using a basic linear regression on selected features.

🛠️ Methodology
The following steps outline the modeling workflow:

Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understanding data distributions, relationships between features, and identifying outliers.

Feature Engineering:
Creating meaningful new variables and selecting relevant features for modeling.

Model Training:
Applying regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, or Gradient Boosting.

Model Evaluation:
Using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE) to assess model performance.

Prediction & Submission:
Generating predictions on the test set and formatting the output as per sample_submission.csv.

📈 Results
The baseline model leverages linear regression on a few key features (year and month of sale, lot area, bedrooms). Further improvements can be achieved through advanced modeling and hyperparameter tuning.
