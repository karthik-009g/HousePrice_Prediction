üè° HousePrice_Prediction
House price prediction using Ames Iowa data. This machine learning project focuses on estimating home sale prices based on property features. The dataset includes details like sale dates, lot size, bedroom counts, and location factors. Good for practicing regression models and data analysis workflows.

Main goal is creating a model that predicts prices accurately. Uses structural characteristics and neighborhood info. Lets you work through data cleaning steps first. Missing value handling, category encoding, numerical standardization all part of prep work.

Dataset files included here are training data with sale prices attached. Test data without prices for prediction practice. There's a description file explaining each feature originally made by Dean De Cock. Sample submission shows basic linear regression format.

Methodology starts with preprocessing raw information. Handling missing data comes first. Then exploratory analysis checks distributions and outliers. Feature engineering creates new variables from existing ones while selecting relevant predictors.

Model training uses regression approaches like linear models as baseline tests. Ridge and lasso methods get mentioned for regularization purposes too. Evaluation metrics include RMSE and R-squared scores showing how well predictions match actuals.

Performance numbers show similar train-test results suggesting decent generalization. About 87% variance explained according to R¬≤ values. MAE errors around 0.10-0.11 indicate average prediction gaps.

Next steps involve trying regularized models to prevent overfitting with more features added later on might help improve accuracy further down the line too if done right you know ensemble methods like XGBoost could push metrics better still visualization of predictions versus real prices would help spot where models struggle most maybe focus there first before diving into complex tweaks anyway that's the basic outline here pretty straightforward approach overall no fancy stuff just core ML workflow steps applied to housing data classic regression problem setup really typical in this field but good practice material regardless especially for new practitioners looking to build portfolio pieces quickly without getting bogged down in overly complex datasets from day one you know how it goes keep it simple start small iterate often yeah that works best usually in my experience at least when dealing with tabular structured information like this Ames set provides solid foundation for learning ropes properly no doubt about it solid project base to expand upon later as skills grow over time naturally enough anyway there you have it main points covered adequately I'd say maybe missing some deeper insights but covers essentials sufficiently for now period end of story period
