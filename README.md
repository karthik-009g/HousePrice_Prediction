**🏠 House Price Prediction**
*Predicting residential home sale prices in Ames, Iowa using machine learning*

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting house sale prices using real-world data from Ames, Iowa. The dataset offers a rich collection of features describing residential properties — making it an ideal playground for regression modeling, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering.

**🎯 Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to build a robust predictive model that estimates a home’s final sale price based on key attributes such as:

- Year and month of sale  
- Lot size (square footage)  
- Number of bedrooms  
- Structural characteristics (e.g., overall quality, basement size)  
- Location-based features (e.g., neighborhood, zoning)

This project serves as a hands-on case study for practicing end-to-end data science workflows — from preprocessing and EDA to modeling and evaluation.

**🗂️ Dataset Overview**

The dataset includes the following files:

 **`train.csv`** — Training data with features and the target variable (`SalePrice`)
 **`test.csv`** — Test data (features only); your task is to predict `SalePrice`
 **`data_description.txt`** — Detailed descriptions of all features (compiled by Dean De Cock)
 **`sample_submission.csv`** — Template for submission format, generated using a basic linear regression model

 **🛠️ Methodology**

The modeling pipeline follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
Handling missing values intelligently (imputation, deletion, or flagging)
Encoding categorical variables (label encoding, one-hot encoding)
Scaling/standardizing numerical features where necessary

 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Visualizing distributions and correlations
Identifying outliers and anomalies
Understanding feature-target relationships

 3. **Feature Engineering**
- Creating new informative features (e.g., total square footage, age of house)
- Selecting relevant features using statistical or model-based methods
- Reducing dimensionality and multicollinearity

4. **Model Training**
Experimenting with multiple regression algorithms:
Linear Regression
Ridge & Lasso Regression (for regularization)
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

5. **Model Evaluation**
Primary metric: **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** on log-transformed SalePrice (as commonly used in Kaggle competitions)
Cross-validation for robust performance estimation

 6. **Prediction & Submission**
Generating predictions on the test set
Formatting output to match `sample_submission.csv` for easy submission

**📈 Model Perfomance**
|Dataset| RMSE | R²   | MAE  |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Train | 0.15 | 0.86 | 0.10 |
| Test  | 0.15 | 0.87 | 0.11 |



✅ **Baseline Model**: A simple linear regression using only a few features (year/month of sale, lot area, number of bedrooms). While interpretable, this model can be significantly improved.

🚀 **Next Steps**:
- Fix data leakage issue
- Implement advanced models (e.g., ensemble methods)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, Optuna)
- Engineer more powerful features
- Optimize for public/private leaderboard performance (if submitting to Kaggle)
